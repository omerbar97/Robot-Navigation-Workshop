<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>
Our second-year Computer Science project focuses on developing a robot navigation system using the Player/Stage platform and integrating the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL) algorithms. We aim to create an autonomous navigation system that enables a mobile robot to navigate its environment efficiently and safely. The project involves perception, mapping, path planning, and control components. By leveraging Player/Stage and OMPL, we will build a robust and optimized system. Throughout the project, we anticipate challenges in algorithm tuning and system integration. The code and documentation in this repository provide an overview of our implementation progress. Join us on this exciting journey into the world of robot navigation!</p>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<p>To successfully run and utilize the robot navigation project, the following dependencies are required:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Player/Stage: The Player/Stage platform provides the foundation for our robot navigation system. Ensure that Player/Stage is properly installed and configured on your system. can download <a href="https://playerstage.sourceforge.net/doc/Stage-3.2.1/install.html">here</li>
  <li>C++ Compiler: A compatible C++ compiler is needed to compile and build the project code. We recommend using a recent version of GCC or Clang.</li>
  <li>Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL): OMPL is a key component of our project, providing state-of-the-art motion planning algorithms. Install the OMPL library and its dependencies according to the official documentation for your system. can download <a href="https://github.com/ompl/ompl">here</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>Ensure that all the necessary dependencies are installed and configured correctly on your system before attempting to run the project. This will ensure a smooth execution and enable you to explore the capabilities of our robot navigation system effectively.</p>
